Prediction for Bike sharing demand

Problem Statement
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues and hired a consulting firm to find the factors influencing demand for their bikes. They aim to identify :

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.

How well those variables describe the bike demands.

You need to model the demand for shared bikes using the available independent variables. Management will use this to understand how different features impact demand and adjust their business strategy accordingly. Additionally, the model will help them grasp the demand dynamics in a new market.

Steps for Model Building
1.Reading and Understanding Data
2.Data cleanup
3.Visulaizing data
4.Splitting data into train-test
5.Scaling the variables
6.Build the Model
7.Residual analysis of train data
8.Making predictions using final model
